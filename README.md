# cone-game
Solving the hardest level of a puzzle involving cones featured regularly at the Math Department's popularization of science week
Neither I nor any of my peers could solve this one last time and I think it made for a fun coding exercise

# Rules
The rules for the game are pretty simple. You are given a 5x5 grid (though it could extend to any sized 2-dimensional grid) and some cones on said grid. All of them are equal except for a target cone. The objective of the game is to move the target cone to the center of the grid (or it could be to any designated cell). The rules for moving are as follows: you can move any cone you want in any of the cardinal directions, but you can only move the cone until it hits another cone. In other words, if you move in a direction, the cone will move in that direction until it hits something. You can't just move a cone a certain amount of places, and if there is nothing to stop the cone's movement in that direction then the cone will "fall off the edge" so that movement is not allowed (although it could be fun to explore the variation where we allow such movements, although I don't know whether the resulting puzzles will be fun or challenging)
